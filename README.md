Consider you're attending a business meeting where all conversations are being captured by an advanced AI application. 

This application not only transcribes the discussions with high accuracy but also provides a concise summary of the meeting, emphasizing the key points and decisions made.

In this project, we'll use OpenAI's Whisper to transform speech to text. Next, we'll use IBM Watson's AI to summarize and find key points. We'll make an app with Hugging Face Gradio as the user interface.
